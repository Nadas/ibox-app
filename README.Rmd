Task 1
-----------------
GoogleDriveFileSyncManagerTest class was created with 4 testing methods (testAddFile, testDeleteFile, testUpdateFile, and testGetFileID)
 for each of the corresponding methods within the main class.


Task 2
-----------------
On the other hand, GoogleDriveFileSyncManagerIntegrationTest has five test methods, where the fifth one implements a watchDirectory API
where changes within the directory as also reported. This class was commented out as a whole during the automated testing and testing with 
Maven processes as it cause some problems due to its connection to the Internet.

Task 3
-----------------
"mvn package" command line was successfully used to trigger the testing process as well as generating the .jar file of the project.

Task 4
-----------------
This GitHub repo was connected to CircleCI for automated testing. At first @Test annotations were commented out to generate a 
"NO TESTS" failure, however that didn't work, thus a simple modification to one of the assert lines was reversed to trigger a
failure. The GoogleDriveFileSyncManagerIntegrationTest was also commented out during this task.

Task 5 and 6
-----------------
Cobertura, CheckStyle and FindBugs were integrated to the build process.
